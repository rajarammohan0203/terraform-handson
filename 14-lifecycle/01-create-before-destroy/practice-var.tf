# PRACTICE CHALLENGE
# 1. Apply the code initially.
# 2. Change the "Version" tag in real_world_example.tf from "v1" to "v2".
# 3. Run `terraform apply`.
# 4. OBSERVE THE LOGS!
#    - Standard: "Destroying..." -> "Creating..."
#    - With lifecycle: "Creating..." -> "Destroying..."

# This small flag determines if your customers see a 503 error or not!
